Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Poject2

## The Real World Environment
As you've seen, the environment for this project involves controlling a double-jointed arm, to reach target locations.

### Real-World Robotics
Watch this YouTube video to see how some researchers were able to train a similar task on a real robot! The accompanying research paper can be found here.

#### Sharing Experience
In the second version of the project environment, there are 20 identical copies of the agent. It has been shown that having multiple copies of the same agent sharing experience can accelerate learning, and you'll discover this for yourself when solving the project!

Sharing experience can accelerate learning.
